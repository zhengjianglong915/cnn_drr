Ms. Haag plays Elianti

The oboist Heinz Holliger has taken a hard line about the problem: He commissions and splendidly interprets fearsome contemporary scores and does some conducting, so he doesn't have to play the same Mozart and Strauss concertos over and over again
Years ago, he collaborated with the new music gurus Peter Serkin and Fred Sherry in the very countercultural chamber group Tashi, which won audiences over to dreaded contemporary scores like Messiaen's "Quartet for the End of Time
Just the thing for the Vivaldi-at-brunch set, the yuppie audience that has embraced New Age as its very own easy listening
He believes in what he plays, and he plays superbly
His recent appearance at the Metropolitan Museum, dubbed "A Musical Odyssey," was a case in point
It felt more like a party, or a highly polished jam session with a few friends, than a classical concert
He launched into Saint-Saens's "The Swan" from "Carnival of the Animals," a favorite encore piece for cellists, with lovely, glossy tone and no bite
Mr. Stoltzman introduced his colleagues: Bill Douglas, pianist/bassoonist/composer and an old buddy from Yale, and jazz bassist Eddie Gomez
An improvisational section was built around pieces by Mr. Douglas, beginning with "Golden Rain," a lilting, laid-back lead in to the uptempo "Sky," which gave Mr. Stoltzman the opportunity to wail in a high register and show off his fleet fingers
Bach's "Air" followed
Mr. Stoltzman tied the composer in by proclaiming him "the great improviser of the 18th century
Glamorous and pure-voiced as ever, Ms. Collins sang Joni Mitchell's "For Free" -- about an encounter with a street-corner clarinetist, to which Mr. Stoltzman contributed a clarinet obligatto -- and Mr. Douglas's lush setting of a Gaelic blessing, "Deep Peace
It was all too mellow to be believed, but they probably would have gotten away with it, had they not felt compelled to add Ms. Collins's signature tune, "Amazing Grace," and ask for audience participation
That went over the permissible line for warm and fuzzy feelings
Either way it was a pity
He warned us in advance that "New York Counterpoint" lasts 11 1/2 minutes
The rest of the concert was more straight jazz and mellow sounds written by Charlie Parker, Ornette Coleman, Bill Douglas and Eddie Gomez, with pictures for the Douglas pieces
It was enjoyable to hear accomplished jazz without having to sit in a smoke-filled club, but like the first half, much of it was easy to take and ultimately forgettable
but can audiences really enjoy them only if the music is purged of threatening elements, served up in bite-sized morsels and accompanied by visuals

Slides to illustrate Shostakovich quartets
The personal antics of agency Director Amadou-Mahtar M'Bow drew much attention, such as when several of his top aides were uncovered as KGB plants and ejected from France and when a mysterious office fire was set just before Congress sent accountants to trace U.S. funds
Several ridiculous projects continue, including the "New International Economic Order," which means redistributionism from the West to pay for everyone else's statism
The Orwellian "New World Information Order" would give government officials rights against the press; journalists would be obliged to kowtow to their government, which would have licensing and censorship powers and, indeed, duties to block printing of "wrong" ideas

Million-dollar conferences were held to chew on subjects such as "ethical responsibilities of scientists in support of disarmament" and "the impact of the activities of transnational corporations
but Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last year admitted, "The exaggerated ideological approach undermined tolerance intrinsic to UNESCO
Mr. Mayor's hope that references to "press freedom" would survive unamended seems doomed to failure
the current phrasing is "educating the public and media to avoid manipulation
He hasn't been able to replace the M'Bow cabal
Soviets remain in charge of education programs, a former head of an African military tribunal for executions is in charge of culture, and a hard-line Polish communist in exile directs the human-rights and peace division
Of the agency's 2,750 staff members, 230 are in the field working on actual projects, such as literacy and oceanographic research
John Bolton, the assistant secretary of state for international organizations, told Congress that the continuing "statist, restrictive, nondemocratic" programs make rejoining any time soon "extremely unlikely
This hasn't much bothered the UNESCO delegates
Free markets, free minds and free elections have an appeal that seems to get muddled only when delivered through U.N. organizations -- which of course are made up largely of governments that fear these principles at home
This can have its purposes at times, but there's no reason to cloud the importance and allure of Western concepts of freedom and justice
We can see plenty of reasons to stay out, and none to rejoin UNESCO
In a labor-intensive process, the seed companies cut off the tassels of each plant, making it male sterile.
They sow a row of male-fertile plants nearby
The vast majority of the U.S. corn crop now is grown from hybrid seeds produced by seed companies
The male part, the anthers of the plant, and the female, the pistils, of the same plant are within a fraction of an inch or even attached to each other.
The anthers in these plants are difficult to clip off
In China, a great number of workers are engaged in pulling out the male organs of rice plants using tweezers, and one-third of rice produced in that country is grown from hybrid seeds
At Plant Genetic Systems, researchers have isolated a pollen-inhibiting gene that can be inserted in a plant to confer male sterility
They attached a second gene, for herbicide resistance, to the pollen-inhibiting gene.
The application of herbicide would kill off the male-fertile plants, leaving a large field of male-sterile plants that can be cross-pollinated to produce hybrid seed
One technique developed by some of these companies involves a chemical spray supposed to kill only a plant's pollen
